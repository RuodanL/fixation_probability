# Fixation probability of 3-uniform hypergraphs on model 1

Here we provide the python code for getting the fixation probability of 3-uniform hypergraph with arbitrary values of N:

- complete_numerical_larger_N.py -- to get the fixation probability of complete 3-uniform hypergraph with N=20 and 200.
- cycle_numerical_larger_N.py -- to get the fixation probability of cyclic 3-uniform hypergraph with N=20 and 200.
- star_numerical_larger_N.py -- to get the fixation probability of star 3-uniform hypergraph with N=20 and 200.
- star_omp_with_weight.py -- to get the fixation probability of the one-mode projection of star 3-uniform hypergraph with N=20 and 200.
