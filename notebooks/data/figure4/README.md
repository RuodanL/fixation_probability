# Fixation probability on star 3-uniform hypergraphs under model 2

Here we provide the python code for calculating the fixation probability on star 3-uniform hypergraphs with arbitrary number of nodes, $N$:

- `m_rule_star_num.py` to get the fixation probability on the star 3-uniform hypergraph.

You can specify the $N$ value in this .py file. To produce the results for our article, which we placed in this folder, we set $N=20$ and $N=200$.
