# Fixation probability for the birth-death process on the weighted one-mode projection of the star 3-uniform hypergraph

Here we provide the Python code for calculating the fixation probability on the one-mode projection of the star 3-uniform hypergraph with arbitrary number of nodes, $N$:

- `star_omp_with_weight.py` to get the fixation probability on the one-mode projection of the star 3-uniform hypergraph.

You can specify the $N$ value in this .py file. To produce the results for our article, which we placed in this folder, we set $N=4, 5, 20$, and $N=200$.
