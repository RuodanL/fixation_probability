# Fixation probability for the birth-death process on the weighted one-mode projection of the star 3-uniform hypergraph

Here we provide the python code for getting the fixation probability for the one-mode projection of the star 3-uniform hypergraph with arbitrary values of $N$:

- star_omp_with_weight.py -- to get the fixation probability for one-mode projection of the star 3-uniform hypergraph with $N=4, 5, 20, and 200$.
