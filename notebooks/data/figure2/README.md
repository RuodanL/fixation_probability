# Fixation probability of 3-uniform hypergraphs under model 1

Here we provide the python code for getting the fixation probability of 3-uniform hypergraph with arbitrary values of $N$:

- complete_numerical_larger_N.py -- to get the fixation probability of complete 3-uniform hypergraph with $N=20$ and $200$.
- cycle_numerical_larger_N.py -- to get the fixation probability of cyclic 3-uniform hypergraph with $N=20$ and $200$.
- star_numerical_larger_N.py -- to get the fixation probability of star 3-uniform hypergraph with $N=20$ and $200$.
