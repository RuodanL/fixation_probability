# Fixation probability on hypergraphs with high symmetry

We provide here code to accompany the following paper:

R. Liu, N. Masuda.
Fixation dynamics on hypergraphs.
Preprint on arXiv: [I will update here when I get the arXiv identifier number](pending URL)

## Jupyter notebook to create figures

```
figure_X.ipynb
```
contains the code to produce fig X in the manuscript, where $X = 2, 4, 5$, and E.~$6$.
The folder [notebooks/data/](https://github.com/DrrD1990/concurrency/tree/main/notebooks/data) contains the numerical results based on which Figures 2-5, and E.6 are produced.

## Python code for running evolutionary dynamics on empirical hypergraphs

The following Python codes are also included:

- SIS_Model_1prime.py -- to simulate the SIS model on networks with partnership model 1'.
- SIS_Model_2.py -- to simulate the SIS model on networks with partnership model 2.
- SIS_Model_1dprime.py -- to simulate the SIS model on networks with partnership model 1''.
- SIS_Model_3.py -- to simulate the SIS model on networks with partnership model 3.
- SIR_Model_1prime.py -- to simulate the SIR model on networks with partnership model 1'.
- SIR_Model_2.py -- to simulate the SIR model on networks with partnership model 2.
- SIR_Model_1dprime.py -- to simulate the SIR model on networks with partnership model 1''.
- SIR_Model_3.py -- to simulate the SIR model on networks with partnership model 3.
