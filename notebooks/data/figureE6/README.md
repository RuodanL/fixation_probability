# Fixation probability on the weighted one-mode projection of the star 3-uniform hypergraph under model 1

- `star_omp_with_weight.py` calculates the fixation probability on the one-mode projection of the star 3-uniform hypergraph with an arbitrary number of nodes, $N$, under model 1.

You can specify the $N$ value in this .py file. To produce the results for our article, which we placed in this folder, we set $N=4, 5, 20$, and $N=200$.
