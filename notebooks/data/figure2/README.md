# Fixation probability on 3-uniform hypergraphs under model 1

Here we provide the Python code for calculating the fixation probability on the following 3-uniform hypergraphs with an arbitrary number of nodes, $N$, under model 1.

- `complete_numerical_larger_N.py` calculates the fixation probability on the complete 3-uniform hypergraph.
- `cycle_numerical_larger_N.py` calculates the fixation probability on the cyclic 3-uniform hypergraph.
- `star_numerical_larger_N.py` calculates the fixation probability on the star 3-uniform hypergraph.

You can specify the $N$ value in these .py files. To produce the results for our article, which we placed in this folder, we set $N=20$ and $N=200$.
