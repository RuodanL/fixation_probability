# Python code for running evolutionary dynamics

The following Python codes are included:

- bd-on-hypergraph.py -- to simulate the birth-death process on an arbitrary connected hypergraph under model 1.
- bd-on-one-mode-projection.py -- to simulate the birth-death process on the weighted one-mode projection of an arbitrary connected hypergraph.

Here we provide an artificial hypergraph data as an example:

- artificial_edgelist.txt -- the first column corresponds to all nodes and the second column corresponds to all hyperedges, each row represents that the node belongs to the hyperedge
