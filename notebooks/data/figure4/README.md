# Fixation probability of star 3-uniform hypergraphs under model 2

Here we provide the python code for getting the fixation probability of star 3-uniform hypergraphs with arbitrary values of $N$:

- m_rule_star_num.py -- to get the fixation probability of star 3-uniform hypergraph with $N=20$ and $200$.
